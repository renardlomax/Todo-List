# Todo-List Exercise
This was our week 14 todo list assighnment. Learned how to use React and to refactor code.
## How To Run
Clone/download the following files:

- index.html
- form.js
- index.js
- styles.css
- todo.js
- a.jpg

Once the files are downloaded, drag the index.html file onto your browser window. Type a new todo action or click to remove task. 

## Future Improvements
- adding cool animations to let you know the task is done.
